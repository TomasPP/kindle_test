This plays around with some REST API's that are behind "Manage Your Content and Devices" Amazon page (URL: https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/myx).
Mainly two functions: listing Kindle Content Items and bulk deleting some of them. This Amazon REST API is undocumented and private.
So the code is written based on the analysis of HTTP traffic.

This is half-baked code written for self-education purposes.

Another reason for this code: I was using Instapaper service functionality to forward read later articles to Kindle.
So I ended up with hundreds of Instapaper related documents in Kindle Cloud storage and no way to conveniently delete
them as Amazon UI at the time was not permitting bulk deletes.

Other people's similar projects:
https://github.com/fatso83/amazon_fiona older version of Amazon Kindle Cloud Storage REST API was called FIONA. Now it seem to do not permit delete action on KindlePDoc items anymore.

Usage:
You can use Intellij project for running it.

Or build project with Maven in project directory:
mvn package
this creates target dir with jar in project directory.

Before running modify headers.txt file with your request header values.
Take them after you login to your https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/myx page in Chrome browser.
https://www.mkyong.com/computer-tips/how-to-view-http-headers-in-google-chrome/
Click view source near Response Headers and copy to the headers.txt
Note: if you do not see view source near Response Headers and you see headers that start with ':' like ':host'. That means you are seeing HTTP2 traffic.
This code is HTTP1.1 client so restart Chrome with command line argument --disable-http2. Make sure Chrome is really restarted and there is no lingering chrome.exe in Task manager.

Get csrfToken token value:
Do view source and search for 'csrfToken' in the page after you login to https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/myx
You will find:
var csrfToken = "gA/NiEMCVvnEXTLvD1WkNnQzJfbshp25QZDx/4oAAAAJAAAAAFuBTE9yYXcAAAAA";
csrfToken is sent in every REST API request payload so another place is to URL decode it from the payload.

Then run command line from project directory:
java -jar target/kindle_test-1.0.jar <csrfToken>

Check the output of the program. Also check list_log.txt

For delete action KindleContentTest.java uncomment line bulkDeleteKindleItems
//        bulkDeleteKindleItems(headers, csrfToken);

After execution check delete_log.txt for more details.
Also see notes.txt for analysis notes on the Amazon REST API.
